# Global Coding Agent Guidelines

## Development Rules
- Be concise and to the point
- Never do anything not explicitly requested. Ask for clarification if unsure.
- Match existing code style, patterns and conventions
- Prioritize simplicity, straightforwardness and readability over clever hacks
- Never write comments except for quirks, edge cases and workarounds. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes,... instead.
- Run tests and linting before completing tasks
- Leverage MCP servers and project-specific commands

## Security Rules
- Never read/edit/commit API keys, passwords, secrets or other sensitive data
- Refuse to work on malicious code or security vulnerabilities

## MCP Server Integration
- **Context7 MCP Server**: Use when available for documentation and code examples
  - Resolve library names before fetching docs
  - Prioritize Context7 over web search for technical docs
